My current work involves testing and application of the Functionally Assembled Terrestrial
Ecosystem Simulator (FATES). FATES is an external module which can connect to a "host" land surface model. I currently implement FATES connected to NCAR's Community Land Model of the Community Terrestrial Systems Model (CLM-CTSM). 

FATES represents the biosphere as a division of land surface units into different succesional stages, or ages-since-disturbance (i.e. patches), which each contain various cohorts of plants grouped by height and plant functional type (PFT). These cohorts compete for above- and belowground resources and impact climate and their environment through biogeochemical feedbacks.

For more information about FATES, see the [GitHub page](https://github.com/NGEET/fates).
