    Currently a <a href="/FATES"><strong>Project Scientist</strong></a> at the
    <a href="https://ncar.ucar.edu/">National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)</a> 
    in the Terrestrial Sciences Section. Previously held 
    <a href="/UVAFME"><strong>postdoctoral positions</strong></a> at 
    NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and Northern Arizona University.

    Obtained my PhD in <strong>Environmental Sciences</strong> from the University of Virginia (supervised by
    <a href="https://evsc.as.virginia.edu/people/profile/hhs">Hank Shugart</a>) and my BA in Environmental Sciences,
    also from the UVA. My dissertation work involved investigating the combined effects of spruce beetle
    outbreaks and climate change in western US forests through ecological modeling and remote sensing.

    I am interested in high-resolution modeling of forest ecosystems, remote sensing of vegetation characteristics,
    vegetation stress, and disturbances, and disturbance-vegetation-climate interactions.
