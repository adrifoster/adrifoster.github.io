    Currently a <a href="/FATES"><strong>Project Scientist</strong></a> at the
    <a href="https://ncar.ucar.edu/">National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)</a> 
    in the Terrestrial Sciences Section. Previously held 
    <a href="/UVAFME"><strong>postdoctoral positions</strong></a> at 
    NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and Northern Arizona University.

    Obtained my PhD in <strong>Environmental Sciences</strong> from the University of Virginia (supervised by
    <a href="https://evsc.as.virginia.edu/people/profile/hhs">Hank Shugart</a>) and my BA in Environmental Sciences,
    also from the UVA. My dissertation work involved investigating the combined effects of spruce beetle
    outbreaks and climate change in western US forests through ecological modeling and remote sensing.

    I enjoy developing scientific code for mechanistic modeling, as well as useful analysis and processing scripts. 
    I am proficient in Fortran, Python, and R, as well as utilizing high-performance clusters 
    for large data analysis and modeling, and analysis of remote sensing data and imagery
    in R and GEE. I also enjoy utilizing 3-D modeling and animation software for 
    data visualization and science communication.
