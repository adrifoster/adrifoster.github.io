  <p style="text-align:center">My work involves using ecological modeling combined with 
  field and remote sensing observations to better understand our Earth system. 
  In particular, I seek to discover how vegetation will interact with ongoing changes 
  in climate and disturbance regimes. New modeling, data analysis, and remote sensing tools 
  are constantly coming online, setting the stage for global application of 
  computationally intensive and high-resolution studies. 
  My research focuses on leveraging these tools to answer crucial questions about 
  our changing planet.</p>
