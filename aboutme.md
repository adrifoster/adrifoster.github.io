subtitle: Ecological modeler and Fortran enthusiast

I am a forest ecologist and ecological modeler, specifically interested in high-resolution modeling of forest ecosystems, remote sensing of vegetation characteristics and stress, and disturbance-vegetation-climate interactions. I received my PhD at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, VA and subsequently held postdoctoral positions at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, MD and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, AZ. My graduate and postdoctoral work focused on developing and applying a forest model in boreal North America. In 2021, I started a Project Scientist position at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), focusing on FATES-CTSM development and application.
